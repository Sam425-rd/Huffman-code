When you boil it down, emotional intelligence is the idea that emotions
are useful; they are important sources of information. Emotions help
us solve problems, and they guide our social interactions. And, importantly,
some people harness the wisdom of emotions better than others.
So, who are these emotionally intelligent people? They are individuals you
know, and you might be one yourself. If you are the kind of person who is
skilled at reading emotions in another person’s face or interpreting your feelings,
if you are a person who can put your feelings into words, if you are a
person who manages your emotions effectively and helps others to do the
same, and if you are a person who uses your emotions to think clearly about
something or as clues to what might be going on in social situations, well
then, you are likely someone who is emotionally intelligent. And, if you are
not so sure whether you are this kind of person, perhaps this book will help
you to learn these skills.
In 1990, when John D. Mayer and I published the first scientific article
describing a theory of emotional intelligence in the journal Imagination,
Cognition, and Personality, we weren’t sure anyone would find the idea that
people differ in their abilities to identify emotions, understand these feelings,
manage emotions, and use them to guide thinking and action all that interesting
or persuasive. We were wrong. Today, in the spring of 2009, while writing
this foreword, I typed the phrase emotional intelligence into the Google
search engine, and it yielded more than three million hits. Interest in emotional
intelligence has exploded, and we know a few things now that we didn’t
know two decades ago.
First, we know that you can measure emotional intelligence, and the author
of this book, Steven Stein, is chief executive officer of the company that publishes
assessment tools in this area of psychology, including a test we developed
called the MSCEIT. Second, we know that high scores on the MSCEIT
and other measures of emotional intelligence are related to psychological
health, effectiveness at work, and fulfilling social relationships. And third,
we know that people can learn how to improve these skills in many different
ways. For example, our colleague Marc Brackett has developed and tested
school curricula that help children learn emotional intelligence (and do
better in school).
