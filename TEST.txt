preface
I irst got into programming as a hobby. Visual Basic 6 for Dummies
taught me the basics, and I kept reading books to learn more. But the
subject of algorithms was impenetrable for me. I remember savoring
the table of contents of my irst algorithms book, thinking “I’m inally
going to understand these topics!” But it was dense stuf, and I gave
up ater a few weeks. It wasn’t until I had my irst good algorithms
professor that I realized how simple and elegant these ideas were.
A few years ago, I wrote my irst illustrated blog post. I’m a visual
learner, and I really liked the illustrated style. Since then, I’ve written
a few illustrated posts on functional programming, Git, machine
learning, and concurrency. By the way: I was a mediocre writer when
I started out. Explaining technical concepts is hard. Coming up with
good examples takes time, and explaining a diicult concept takes time.
So it’s easiest to gloss over the hard stuf. I thought I was doing a pretty
good job, until ater one of my posts got popular, a coworker came up
to me and said, “I read your post and I still don’t understand this.” I still
had a lot to learn about writing.
Somewhere in the middle of writing these blog posts, Manning reached
out to me and asked if I wanted to write an illustrated book. Well, it
turns out that Manning editors know a lot about explaining technical
concepts, and they taught me how to teach. I wrote this book to scratch
a particular itch: I wanted to write a book that explained hard technical
topics well, and I wanted an easy-to-read algorithms book. My writing
has come a long way since that irst blog post, and I hope you ind this
book an easy and informative read.

acknowledgments
Kudos to Manning for giving me the chance to write this book and
letting me have a lot of creative freedom with it. hanks to publisher
Marjan Bace, Mike Stephens for getting me on board, Bert Bates for
teaching me how to write, and Jennifer Stout for being an incredibly
responsive and helpful editor. hanks also to the people on Manning’s
production team: Kevin Sullivan, Mary Piergies, Tifany Taylor,
Leslie Haimes, and all the others behind the scenes. In addition, I
want to thank the many people who read the manuscript and ofered
suggestions: Karen Bensdon, Rob Green, Michael Hamrah, Ozren
Harlovic, Colin Hastie, Christopher Haupt, Chuck Henderson, Pawel
Kozlowski, Amit Lamba, Jean-François Morin, Robert Morrison,
Sankar Ramanathan, Sander Rossel, Doug Sparling, and Damien White.
hanks to the people who helped me reach this point: the folks on the
Flaskhit game board, for teaching me how to code; the many friends
who helped by reviewing chapters, giving advice, and letting me try
out diferent explanations, including Ben Vinegar, Karl Puzon, Alex
Manning, Esther Chan, Anish Bhatt, Michael Glass, Nikrad Mahdi,
Charles Lee, Jared Friedman, Hema Manickavasagam, Hari Raja, Murali
Gudipati, Srinivas Varadan, and others; and Gerry Brady, for teaching
me algorithms. Another big thank you to algorithms academics like
CLRS, Knuth, and Strang. I’m truly standing on the shoulders of giants.
Dad, Mom, Priyanka, and the rest of the family: thank you for your
constant support. And a big thank you to my wife Maggie. here are
many adventures ahead of us, and some of them don’t involve staying
inside on a Friday night rewriting paragraphs.
Finally, a big thank you to all the readers who took a chance on this
book, and the readers who gave me feedback in the book’s forum.
You really helped make this book better.
