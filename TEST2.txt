When, How, and Why Might Positive
Activities Undermine Well-Being
Megan M. Fritz and Sonja Lyubomirsky
Across the globe, most people desire happiness (Diener, 2000; Diener, Suh,
Smith, & Shao, 1995), and this desire transcends differences in age, culture, geographical
location, political beliefs, religion, and life experiences. The quest for the
secret of how to increase and sustain happiness has preoccupied men and women
for millennia, from the philosophers of ancient Athens to present-day scientists
and scholars (Kesebir & Diener, 2008; McMahon, 2008). Although conceptualizations
of happiness may shift across generations and cultures, the goal of attaining it
remains ubiquitous (McMahon, 2008; Oishi, Graham, Kesebir, & Galinha, 2013).
Notably, happiness is desirable not just because it is pleasurable, but because
it grants numerous benefits to both the individual and those around him or her
(see also Fredrickson, this volume). Happiness (or well-being)—which researchers
define as the experience of frequent positive emotions relative to negative emotions,
coupled with high life satisfaction—predicts, correlates, and begets success
across multiple life domains, including work, relationships, and physical health
(Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005; see also von Hippel & Gonsalkorale; and
Sheldon, this volume). Relative to their less happy counterparts, happy people
have stronger interpersonal relationships, higher incomes, and superior physical
and mental health; they receive more favorable job performance reviews, are more
likely to get married, and live longer on average (e.g., Boehm & Kubzansky, 2012;
Chida & Steptoe, 2008; Lyubomirsky, King, et al., 2005; Simpson, Farrell, Huelsnitz,
& Eller, this volume). Positive emotions have also been shown to prompt
greater creativity and prosocial behavior (see Lyubomirsky, King, et al., 2005, for
a review). Happiness, therefore, does not only feel good—it is good. It pays to be
happy not just for the individual, but for the individual’s social network and his
or her community at large. In this chapter, we will use the terms happiness and
well-being interchangeably.

Almost two decades of research suggest that individuals can increase their
well-being by engaging in so-called positive activities. Longitudinal randomized
controlled trials have shown that purposeful and effortful performance
of positive activities can markedly impact happiness, with average effect sizes of
r = .29 for increasing well-being and r = .31 for decreasing depressive symptoms
(Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). These simple, self-administered positive activities are
designed to increase well-being by mirroring the behaviors (or habits) that happy
people naturally do. They include expressing gratitude or appreciation (Boehm,
Lyubomirsky, & Sheldon, 2011; Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Froh, Sefick, &
Emmons, 2008; Layous, Lee, Choi, & Lyubomirsky, 2013; Lyubomirsky, Dickerhoof,
Boehm, & Sheldon, 2011), doing kind acts for others (Chancellor, Margolis,
Bao, & Lyubomirsky, 2017; Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2008; Layous, Lee, et al.,
2013; Layous, Nelson, Oberle, Schonert-Reichl, & Lyubomirsky, 2012; Nelson,
Layous, Cole, & Lyubomirsky, 2016; Pressman, Kraft, & Cross, 2014; see also Huppert,
this volume), cultivating optimism (Boehm et al., 2011; Layous, Nelson, &
Lyubomirsky, 2013; Lyubomirsky et al., 2011; Peters, Flink, Boersma, & Linton,
2010; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2006), meditating on positive feelings toward the
self (Neff & Germer, 2013) and others (Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel,
2008), and affirming one’s most important values (Nelson, Fuller, Choi, &
Lyubomirsky, 2014).
The Positive Activity Model: Summary and Evidence
Recent empirical investigation has shifted from simply focusing on whether activities
like expressing gratitude or practicing kindness can increase happiness to asking
how, when, why, and for whom they can do so. Our positive activity model
(Figure 7.1, Layous & Lyubomirsky, 2014; Lyubomirsky & Layous, 2013) offers
predictions for the conditions under which various positive activities may be
more (or less) effective at boosting well-being. This theoretical model identifies
specific moderators and mediators underlying the relationship between positive
activity engagement and increases in well-being. Key moderators pertain to the
activity itself (e.g., how often is the behavior practiced and how novel is it), to the
person performing it (e.g., how motivated the person is to become happier and
if the person believes the activity will work), or to the congruence between the
two (e.g., person-activity fit). Hypothesized mediators, such as the satisfaction of
psychological needs, suggest mechanisms by which positive activities operate to
increase happiness.
